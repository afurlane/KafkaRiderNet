# TestKafkaRider

## Project purpose

The main purpose of this project is to show how to interact MassTransit with SignalR to notify client of processed actions

You could not look at this project without knowing MassTransit. You won't catch the pattern.

Pay special attention to [this](https://masstransit-project.com/usage/exceptions.html#retry)

To test the project there is a docker-compose.yaml to start your own, builtin, personal, one-node kafka instance.
